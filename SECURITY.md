# Security Policy
This framework is designed to secure critical systems. As such, we take security seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues. Instead, please send a detailed report to the maintainer's professional contact to ensure a coordinated disclosure that protects downstream users in the federal supply chain.
